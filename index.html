                <p>
                    Emotional contagion is defined as: the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronise expressions, vocalisations, postures, and movements with those of another person’s and consequently to converge emotionally<sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>. Being observed as early as 1759, when people imagine themselves in another person’s situation, they display a “motor mimicry” of that person’s emotions or expressions<sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>. There has been evidence of mimicry in other species as well. How emotionally susceptible someone is to emotional contagion will depend on gender, race, background, and even genetics<sup><a href="#link5">[5]</a></sup>.

                    In a survey I created, I found that many people didn't know what emotional contagion was, yet they were still affected by it. In the results, people on average on a scale of 1-10 felt about 7.24 emotionally contagious. People also believed behind the idea of emotional contagion, which is being influenced by other peoples' emotions and behaviors. Most people also agreed that it's possible to become emotionally affected even in an online environment. Given how prevalent emotional contagion is in in-person interactions, they are also prevalent in online interactions. Since we are mostly an online society, emotional contagion is still effective in ways such as posts on social media, or even targeted advertising.

                <p>
                    There is evidence that emotional contagion is something that many marketers keep in mind when creating a product to sell to people. The problem with this is using people's own emotions against them in order to sell them and make a profit off of it. Even if it is for something that is useful for people and not just useless junk, there is still an ethical problem with purposefully influencing someone's emotions in order to sell them something. People should be able to make a decision on whether or not they need a product regardless of how an advertisement might emotionally affect them.
