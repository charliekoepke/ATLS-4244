                <p>
                    Emotional contagion is defined as the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronise expressions, vocalisations, postures, and movements with those of another person’s and consequently to converge emotionally<sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>. Observed as early as 1759, people would imagine themselves in another person’s situation and display a “motor mimicry” of that person’s emotions or expressions<sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>. Other species are evidenced to experience of mimicry as well. The extent that someone is susceptible to emotional contagion will depend on gender, race, background, and genetics<sup><a href="#link5">[5]</a></sup>. Emotional contagion has also been shown to be able to spread in online environments, though many studies are still determining emotional contagion is the cause, or some other factor<sup><a href="#link3">[3]</a></sup>.

                <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
                <p>
                    In a survey I created, I found that many people were unaware of what emotional contagion was, yet they were still affected by it. On average, on a scale of 1-10, individuals felt about 7.24 emotionally contagious. Most people also agreed that becoming emotionally affected even in an online environment is possible; they were on average less emotionally contagious in online environments, with an average of about 6.24. Given how prevalent emotional contagion is in in-person interactions, it is also prevalent in online interactions. Since we are largely an online society, emotional contagion is still effective in posts on social media or targeted advertising.

                <p>
                    When emotional contagion is purposefully used to sway individual’s emotions, it is defined as emotional manipulation. Frequently, companies use emotional manipulation in advertising to sell a product, brand, or idea. Sometimes these emotional influences can roll over into decisions that are unrelated to the advertising<sup><a href="#link4">[4]</a></sup>. In a controversial Facebook research study, people’s emotions were altered without their knowledge for the purposes of research, but it angered quite a few people since their emotions were manipulated<sup><a href="#link2">[2]</a></sup>.

                <h2>Emotional Contagion in Advertising</h2>
                <p>
                    It has been shown in some research experiments that usage of emotional manipulation in advertising can also affect some unrelated decisions<sup><a href="#link4">[4]</a></sup>. Emotional manipulation also makes people make decisions they would not make under normal circumstances, which can cause them to spend money unnecessarily, or support something possibly unethical. In the survey I created, most people were uncomfortable with the fact that many advertisements used emotional manipulation to create targeted ads. They also agreed that the current situation of the market, and that our attention, interests, and money are the only things companies want, so they will use any means to achieve that.
